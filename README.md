# Graph Maker

This is an app that has been hastily put together to help people generate graphs portraying the spread of Coronavirus. Despite the rather grim seriously of the subject at hand, it also allows you to pick a colour pattern. Yey! :)

### To do:
New improvements to be brought to the program and its programmer include but are not limited to:
 - [x] Rewrite the README file using markdown
 - [ ] Write an easy way to test each function individually
 - [ ] Get rid of the "settings" file, integrating it in the TKinter side of the project
 - [ ] Look into public API that retrieves data about Coronavirus and integrate it (settings in TKinter)
 - [ ] Integrate a way to resize the graph by other intervals (aka months instead of days)
